Intel Firmware Development Kit - Debug Agent
--------------------------------------------

1. What is the Debug Agent?
---------------------------

The Debug Agent (DBGA), part of Intel Firmware Development Kit (IFDK), is a console application
that enables debugging features focused onto the cAVS firmware.

Here are the currently supported features:
- Module topology discovery
- Module control through parameters
- Firmware log retrieval

Three actors are required to enable cAVS firwmare debugging:
- The FDK tool, a GUI application (the debug engineer front-end). It runs on host.
- A target that embeds a cAVS DSP firmware and the associated audio drivers (OED driver on Windows)
- And finally a Debug Agent application instance, that runs on the target user space.
  This application makes the bridge between the FDK tool and the cAVS firmware

Currently the Debug Agent is a console application that has to be run manually.
In future FDK releases, the Debug Agent will become a Windows service and will be transparently
installed and started by an installer.

2. What are the prerequisites?
------------------------------

One manual provisioning must be performed each time a firmware built by the FDK tool is deployed
on target.

This provisionning is required to enable the "Module control through parameters" feature:
Some files generated by the FDK tool related to a firmware build must be copied onto the board.
These generated files contain the description of module parameters embeded into the firmware.

ON HOST: You have to copy all content (files and dirs) from the following directory:
<project_root_path>/out/cfg_debug/*.*

ON TARGET: Into the following directory:
<DBGA install path>/parameter-framework/cavs/
Note: this directory can be opened easily using the the desktop shortcut "Open DBGA config"

This manual provisioning will disappear in a future FDK release.

3. How to use it
----------------

Click on the desktop shortcut "Run Debug Agent" and check that no error occurs in the opened console
window.
Press Ctr+C to stop it.

4. Troubleshooting
------------------

If this message is printed when the DBGA is launched:

DebugAgent exception: System error: Unable to create driver: Cannot get device i
dentifier: No device found for GUID D562B888-CF36-4C54-841D-10FF7BFF4F60

This message happens on Windows when the OED driver is not installed on the target.
