<h1>Intel Firmware Development Kit - Debug Agent</h1>

<h2>1. What is the Debug Agent?</h2>

<p>The Debug Agent (DBGA), part of Intel Firmware Development Kit (IFDK), is a console application
that enables debugging features focused onto the cAVS firmware.</p>

<p>Here are the currently supported features:
<ul>
<li>Module topology discovery</li>
<li>Module control through parameters</li>
<li>Firmware log retrieval</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Three actors are required to enable cAVS firwmare debugging:
<ul>
<li>The FDK tool, a GUI application (the debug engineer front-end). It runs on host.</li>
<li>A target that embeds a cAVS DSP firmware and the associated audio drivers (OED driver on
Windows)</li>
<li>And finally a Debug Agent application instance, that runs on the target user space.
This application makes the bridge between the FDK tool and the cAVS firmware.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Currently the Debug Agent is a console application that has to be run manually.
In future FDK releases, the Debug Agent will become a Windows service and will be transparently
installed and started by an installer.</p>

<h2>2. What are the prerequisites?</h2>

<p>One manual provisioning must be performed each time a firmware built by the FDK tool is deployed
on target.</p>

<p>This provisionning is required to enable the "Module control through parameters" feature:
Some files generated by the FDK tool related to a firmware build must be copied onto the board.
These generated files contain the description of module parameters embeded into the firmware.</p>

<p><strong>ON HOST:</strong> You have to copy all content (files and dirs) from the following
directory:
<pre>
&lt;project_root_path&gt;/out/cfg_debug/*.*
</pre>

<strong>ON TARGET:</strong> Into the following directory:
<pre>
&lt;DBGA install path&gt;/parameter-framework/cavs/
</pre></p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> this directory can be opened easily using the the desktop shortcut
"Open DBGA config"</p>

<p>This manual provisioning will disappear in a future FDK release.</p>

<h2>3. How to use it</h2>

<p>Click on the desktop shortcut "Run Debug Agent" and check that no error occurs in the opened console
window.</p>
<p>Press Ctr+C to stop it.</p>

<h2>4. Troubleshooting</h2>

<p>If this message is printed when the DBGA is launched:

<pre>
DebugAgent exception: System error: Unable to create driver: Cannot get device i
dentifier: No device found for GUID D562B888-CF36-4C54-841D-10FF7BFF4F60
</pre>

This message happens on Windows when the OED driver is not installed on the target.</p>
