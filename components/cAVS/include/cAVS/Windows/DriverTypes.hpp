/** OED Driver structure uses the NTSTATUS type, which is almost a kernel type. In user mode some
 * NTSTATUS values are missing, for instance STATUS_SUCCESS. But we need this value to test driver
 * result, that's why the header ntstatus.h is included.
 *
 * But including both ntstatus.h (which is basically a driver header) and windows.h makes warnings
 * (macro redefinition)
 *
 * That's why we are using a macro trick to avoid these warnings
 * @see http://kirkshoop.blogspot.com/2011/09/ntstatus.html
 *
 * Defining the macro WIN32_NO_STATUS avoids to define twice NTSTATUS values.
