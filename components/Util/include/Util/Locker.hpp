/** Wraps an object to make each method call atomic
 *
 * Methods of the original object can be accessed through the -> operator and
 * each method call will lock the whole object.
 *
 * Usage example for atomic method call:
 *
 *     int f(Locker &critical)
 *     {
 *         int a = critical->method1(); // atomic call w.r.t. the "critical" object
 *         a += critical->method2(); // atomic call w.r.t. the "critical" object
 *
 *         return a;
 *     }
 *
 * Usage example for atomic sessions:
 *
 *
 *     void f(Locker &critical)
 *     {
 *         int a;
 *
 *         { // critical section
 *             auto locked = critical.lock();
 *
 *             a = locked->method1();
 *             a += locked->method2();
 *         }
 *
 *         a += 1;
